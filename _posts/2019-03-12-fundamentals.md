- overtone: a musical tone which is a part of the harmonic series above a fundamental note, and may be heard with it.
-rhythm: the actual arrangement of durations

## Rhythm
- beat: regular recurrence of short durational units
- accent: emphatic beats
- meter: recurring pattern of strong and weak beates
    - simple meter: duple and triple
    - compound meter

(rhythm 和 meter 的区别是，meter表明了这个小节是几几拍的，rhythm是其实际的节奏)

- syncopation: 切分
- tempo: absolute duration in fractions of a second
    - *adagio*: from *ad agio* 'at ease'
    - *andante*: present participle of *andare* 'to go'
    - *moderato*: 'moderate'

## Pitch
- scale: the pool of pitches available for the making of music (**diatonic scale** and **chromatic scale**)
- interval: the difference between any two pitches (half steps and whole steps)
- octave: one having twice the frequency of the vibration of the other


# The Structures of Music

## Texture
- monophony: one melody
- homophony: accompanying parts have the same rhythm
- polyphony: more melodies are played simultaneously
    - imitative polyphony (e.g. 'row, row, row your boat')

## Tonality and Modality
tone + mode = key


## Form 
- general form: the organization of elements in a musical work
- *a* form: standardized fromall patterns
- outter form and inner form 

## Genre

symphonies, sonatas, madrigals, and operas, etc..
