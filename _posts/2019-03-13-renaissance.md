In the early fifteenth centry, the musicians emphasis on the sonorous, sensuous aspect of the chant rather than on its structureal and authoritarian function. 

New techniques are:
1. paraphrase: embellish traditional chants with extra notes and set them in graceful rhythms. (E.g. Gregorian hymn, 'Ave maris stella' and Guillaume Dufay's Harmonized hymn, 'Ave Maris Stella.' )
2. homophony: result in plainchant harmonization 

# The Mass

By around 1450, the polyphonic Mass had been standardized into a five-section form.

1. Kyrie: a simple prayer (from Greek *Kurie eleeson*, 'Lord, have mercy')
2. Gloria: a long hymn
3. Credo: a recital of the Christian's list of beliefs
4. Sanctus: anothor hymn (from Latin, literally 'holy')
5. Agnus Dei: another prayer ('sheep of God')

# High Renaissance Sytle

Around 1500, this new sytle emerged for Masses, motets and chansons. Chief characteristic:
1. Imitative Counterpoint
2. Homophony

Tempo and dynamics are relatively constant factors. Some *a cappella* is involved.
