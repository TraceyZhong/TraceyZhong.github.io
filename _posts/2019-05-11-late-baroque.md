The age of Absolutism and Age of Science, from around 1700 to 1750.

# Music Life in the Early Eighteenth Century

1. The church.
2. The court. Under the patronage of kings or members of lesser nobility.
3. The opera house.

> The life stories of the two greatest composers of the late Baroque period show a good deal about the interaction between musicians, the patrons who supported them, and the institutions that required music. Johann Sebastian Bach labored as a church organist, a court musician, and then a major composer-ad-administrator for the Lutheran Church. George Frederic Handel, who also had a court position, became a leading opera composer and opera promoter.

# Style Features of Late Baroque Music

1. Rhythm: highly regular and determined; *walking bass*: a bass part that moves in absolutely even notes.
2. Dynamics: the dynamic is steady in the whole section but abrupt dynamic contrasts were preferred. 
3. Tone color: sonority
4. Melody: to the limits of ornateness and luxuriance; ornaments; frequent use of sequence.
5. Texture: mostly polyphonic (or contrapuntal)
6. The Continuo: yet all this polyphony is supported by a solid scaffold of harmony. The central importance of harmony in baroque music appears in the universal practice of the basso continuo chords.
7. Music form: the patronage system asks composers to rely on formulas that could be applied to quickly and efficiently.
