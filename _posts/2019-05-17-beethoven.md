> A new concept of artistic genius was evolving at the time, and Beethoven crystallized this concept powerfully for his own age. He still exemplifies it today. No longer a mere craftsman, to artist suffers and creates; endowed not just with greater talent but with a greater soul than ordinary mortals, the artist suffers and creates for humanity. Music is no longer merely a function of bodily parts like the ear or the figures. It exists in the highest reaches of the artist's spirit.

# Between Classicism and Romanticism

Beethoven occupies between the eighteenth-century Viennese Classical style and nineteenth-century Romanticism. He's roots were firmly Classical--He was a student of Hayden. What sets him apart from Hayden or Mozart is his mood of excitement and urgency.

# Symphony

Some features in his Fifth Symphony:
1. Rhythmic drive
2. Motivic unity
3. Psychological progression

## Scherzo

In some of his work he substitute traditional minuet with *scherzo* A B A, the modification is in the B part, `|:c:|:d c':|`. The second `d c'` is reorchestrated, becoming quieter and quieter, and return to the contrasting A part.
