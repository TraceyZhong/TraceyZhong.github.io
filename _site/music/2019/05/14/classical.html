    <p>In the second part of the eighteenth century, the Classical style emerged in Europe. It had important pioneers in Italy and northern Germany, but was developed particularly by several great composers active in Vienna.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vienna’s greatest years were from 1780 to 1790, during the reign of Emperor Joseph II… It this liberal atmosphere, Franz Joseph Haydn became recognized as the principal composer of Europe; The young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was drawn to the capital in 1781 from Salz-burg to spend his brilliant last decade there. And in 1792 a young musician from the other end of Germany, decided to come to this great musical center to launch his career. His name was Ludwig van Beethoven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the enlightenment period, people started to apply the same same intelligence that solved scientific problems to problems of public morality, education and politics. The pursuit of good life.</p>

<p>It was the edge of rise of concerts. For there were, after all, other public forums for church music and opera (opera houses).Now purely orchestral music, too, moved into the public domain.</p>

<h1 id="style-features-of-classical-music">Style Features of Classical Music</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Rhythm: highly flexible.</li>
  <li>Dynamics: variety and flexibility were also introduced. By insisting on the contrast between loud and soft, soft and very soft, composers made variety in dynamics clearly perceptible and “pleasing”.</li>
  <li>Tone Color: Classical orchestra formed the basis of the symphony orchestra of later times.</li>
  <li>Melody: Tunes: moved much closer to folk and popular music than their baroque predecessors.</li>
  <li>Texture: Homo-phony: (one melody with harmonic accompany)</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="form-in-classical-music">Form in Classical Music</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Repetitions: theme is repeated.</li>
  <li>Cadences: Composers would devise little cadential phrases, often with minimal melodic interest. Multiple cadences are a characteristic and easily recognizable feature of Classical music.</li>
  <li>Classical Forms are more standardized and limited.</li>
</ol>
